# Getting Started

Welcome to **Web3 Marketplace for Otaku Community** documentation.

## What you'll need

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) version 16.14 or above:
  - When installing Node.js, you are recommended to check all checkboxes related to dependencies.

## Work on the documentation

This website is built using [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/), a modern static website generator.

**Run the development server:**

### Installation
```bash
npm install 
```

### Start the site
```bash
npm start
```

This command starts a local development server and opens up a browser window. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.
